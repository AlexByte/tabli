    <span>New in this release:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Basic Session Management:</b> When a Saved Window is closed and re-opened, Tabli will restore all
      previously open tabs in that window. This works even after re-starting Chrome or if Chrome crashes. Of course you can still use the revert <span style="white-space:nowrap">button (<img src="../assets/revert-button.png"></img>)</span> to close all but your explicitly saved tabs (marked with a <img src="../assets/check.png"></img>) .
      <li><b>New keyboard shortcut:</b> Press <code>;</code> to expand or collapse the currently selected window summary.
      <li>If you open the Tabli Popout (by clicking <img src="../assets/popout.png"></img>), it will remain open after re-starting Chrome. If you have a large, high-resolution monitor I highly recommend using the Tabli Popout.
      <li>When navigating with keyboard shortcuts, the selected window will scroll into view.
      <li>Keyboard navigation now wraps: Up from top window moves to bottom of window list and vice versa.
    </ul>
    <span><strong>Reminder:</strong> If you haven't already done so, please take a few seconds to <a class="card-link" target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabli/igeehkedfibbnhbfponhjjplpkeomghi/reviews">Rate Tabli on the Chrome Web Store</a>. Thank You!
