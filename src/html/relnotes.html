      <span>Fixes / Features:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Tabs are now rendered as hyperlinks. This means all of Chrome's context
menu actions for hyperlinks are available in Tabli and behave as expected.
        <li>You can now re-open saved tabs individually. If you expand a closed, saved window and
        click on an individual closed tab, Tabli will re-open the saved window
        with just that tab open. Clicking on the window header (as opposed to a tab) will re-open
        all previously open tabs for that window.
      </ul>
      <span>...plus a few other internal upgrades and minor bug fixes.</span>
